      <p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

      at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

      legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh

      which we are involved.
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests
      or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
      potential threats to the safety of any person.

      information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing
      we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a 'data processor' on
      behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have
      entered into a data processing agreement is the 'data controller' responsible for your personal information, and

      <p>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>
      In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.
      Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our
      Cookie Notice: https://biznesapp.com/cookies.

      <p>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

      In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
      unless otherwise required by law.

      other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than three (3) months past the termination of the user's account.
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
      because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible

      <p>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

      In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security
      measures.
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect
      the security of any personal information we process. However,
      despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
      information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
      hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
      improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
      personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
      should only access the Services within a secure environment.

      <p>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature
      or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      notice.

      <p>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
      In Short; Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
      personal information.
      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The Light' law, permits our users who are
      California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
      of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
